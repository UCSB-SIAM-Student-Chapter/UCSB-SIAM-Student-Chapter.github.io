title: "Schedule of Events"
---

We will hold our chapter kickoff event on September 30th, in which we will plan events for the rest of the quarter and schedule speakers. Our tentative plan is to discuss applications of optimal transport to computational physics, including theoretical ideas and development of some numerical software. This is subject to change based on our planning meeting. If you have any input on topics to discuss during the year, please attend the kickoff meeting!
