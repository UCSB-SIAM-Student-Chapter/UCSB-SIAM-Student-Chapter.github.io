Welcome to the UCSB SIAM Student Chapter. We seek to facilitate an environment for interdisciplinary research and community at UCSB for our applied mathematics students, as well as students from other departments who are interested in applications of their field to applied and computational mathematics. [Please find our schedule of events here](Schedule of Events.qmd). Students from all disciplines are welcome to attend all student chapter events. We welcome both undergraduate and graduate students. 

### Statement of Inclusivity

We strongly encourage students from all backgrounds to participate in our seminar. We are dedicated to fostering an environment where all students, regardless of socioeconomic background, ethinicity, gender identity, and/or sexual orientation are welcome and encouraged to participate and provide their unique perspective on industrial and applied mathematical topics. If we can be of any help or if we can do anything to foster a more welcoming environment, please reach out to a chapter representative.
